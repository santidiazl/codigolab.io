      "p1": "Código Lab was conceived by Daniel Kostiuk, a software engineer with more than 10 years experience in Toronto's tech scene and a graduate of McGill University’s Computer Engineering program. An adventurer at heart, in 2016 Daniel moved to Barcelona after being offered a job as lead instructor at a recently launched bootcamp. It was because of this experience that Daniel developed a true passion for education.",
      "p2": "During a trip to Colombia and after some additional research,",
      "link": " Daniel could not help but notice a crucial need for tech talent ",
      "p2-2": "as a result of the country’s intense digital transformation. He also noticed a lack of accessible options for relevant, high-quality tech education and the lack of diversity in these limited options.",
      "p3": "In 2018, Daniel met his co-founder Santiago Diaz, in Toronto, Canada. They bonded over their love of Colombia and Daniel suggested the idea of starting a coding bootcamp based on the principle of small class sizes. Santiago was sold, and Código Lab was born.",
      "p4": "We are firm believers that to teach how to code in a manner that will truly prepare students for future careers in software development, class sizes must be small - a maximum of 8 students per class. This philosophy, although disadvantageous relative to our competitors, is one we are committed to maintaining for the good of our students and their futures."
